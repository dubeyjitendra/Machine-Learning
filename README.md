 Machine-Learning
 
 
 Preprocessing is very impotant aspects in machine learning so we will also cover preprocessing, beloow are the following points:
 
1.	Variable Identification

2.	Univariate Analysis

3.	Bi-variate Analysis

4- Multi- variate Analysis

5.	Missing values treatment

6.	Outlier treatment

7.	Variable transformation

8.	Variable creation

9. Feature Selection

10. Feature Engginering

11. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)



 
 
 Plan for covering following algorithm step by step to create model:
 
 1- Linear Regression
 
 2- Multi-Variate Regression
 
 3- Decision Tree
 
 4- Random Forests
 
 5- Logistic Regression:
 
 6- K-NN 
 
 7- Naive Bayes Algorithms
 
 8- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
